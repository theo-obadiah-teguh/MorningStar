# Content of this Directory

This directory comprises the main core of the XML scraper. There are three files:
- `main.py` which is the main caller function.
- `scraper.py` which is the SAX implementation.
- `unzip.py` which is a simple utility function.

More details on what each component does are in the respective files themselves.
